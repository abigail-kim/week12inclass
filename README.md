# U.S. National Parks

This web application allows you to browse a small sample of national parks from the National Park Service API.

Purpose:
The purpose of this web application is to encourage people to spend more time outdoors. This app should help people to focus on themselves more to reduce any stress by setting goals, having challenges, and motivational messages.

Concern:
My concern with this web application is that people may compare their progress with that of other people, which can discourage and increase stress in some visitors.

More about the music playlist:
Initially, I wanted to implement different nature sounds tailored to each National Park. But later on, I switched to using this playlist that I've been listening to before called Green, by a Japanese environmental music composer, Hiroshi Yoshimura. I felt that this playlist matched well with the theme of this web application, as the songs included are known as environmental music and evoke the feelings of natural cycles.

Challenges I've faced:
When I first began making this web application, I had a lot of struggles trying to get the NPS API to work, but I was soon able to fix that problem. Other than trying to get the web application to where I wanted it to be, I had the most trouble with creating the Live Deployment. I tried all the possible solutions (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) to get my API and features to work, but it was really hard to get the Live Deployment to work just as well as my local host. 

Conclusion:
Overall, I really enjoyed this final project, where we got to learn about and use the APIs. I especially really liked bringing my ideas to an actual web application as well. It took a lot of revisions to get it to work, but in the end, this project was really fun.
